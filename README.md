# fishconfig

This repo contains my config for my shell, which is [fish].
It goes together with [pathscripts], which contains scripts which aren't shell-specific but I find useful to keep around.

[fish]: https://fishshell.com/
[pathscripts]: https://github.com/alexwlchan/pathscripts

## Installation

```console
$ ln -s (pwd)/config.fish ~/.config/fish/config.fish
```

## My shell prompt

This repo includes my shell prompt config (see [`_prompt.fish`](_prompt.fish)).
